# RSA Signature Generator and Verifier

This repository showcases my implementation of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. The AES algorithm involves key expansion, AddRoundKey, SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns stages. Additionally, I have integrated RSA encryption for secure key generation and management, I also have incorporated the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) scheme to add an extra layer of randomness to the data before encryption.

To run this project you need `Python3>=3.8`. No additional library is required.

To test the funcionalities of this project, just run:

```
python3 assinatura.py text_file.txt
```
